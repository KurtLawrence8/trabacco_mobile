# Technician Report Functionality

## Overview
The technician report functionality allows technicians to submit daily reports about their work on farms. This feature is integrated into the technician landing screen and provides a comprehensive form for reporting various aspects of their daily activities.

4. **Issues Observed** - Text area for reporting any problems found
5. **Disease Detection** - Dropdown with options: "None" or "Yes"
6. **Disease Type** - Text field (only shown when disease is detected)
7. **Description** - General description of the day's work

### Database Schema
The reports are stored in a table with the following structure:
```sql
- id (bigint, auto-increment, primary key)
- technician_id (bigint, foreign key)
- farm_id (bigint, foreign key)
- accomplishments (text)
- issues_observed (text)
- disease_detected (enum: 'None', 'Yes')
